-> AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) is a Windows API that enhances malware protection in Windows applications. 

-> It can be integrated with compatible antimalware software in the system to enhance detection capabilities, including signature-and reputation-based detection.

-> Attackers can bypass Windows AMSI by manipulating elements such as URLs, functions, or internal files

-> Obfuscation involves making code complex and unreadable to bypass AMSI detection. This technique allows attackers to break strings and concatenate them using the + operator. 

-> Attackers can also use tools such as AmsiTrigger to scan scripts against AMSI and identify triggering lines for targeted obfuscation.

-> Attackers can modify this by setting the function to a “Boolean True” value, which results in generating an error during AMSI initialization

-> This allows them to bypass the AMSI through memory allocation and modify the values within the AmsiUtils class.

-> Memory Hijacking  involves hooking the AmsiScanBuffer() function and forcing it to always return AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN, which indicates that AMSI has found no signs of malware
