-> An “evasion” attack occurs when the IDS discards packets while the host that has to get the packets accepts them.

-> Using this technique, an attacker exploits the host computer. Evasion attacks have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the IDS. 

-> An evasion attack at the IP layer allows an attacker to attempt arbitrary attacks against hosts on a network without the IDS ever realizing it. 

-> The attacker sends portions of the request in packets that the IDS mistakenly rejects, allowing the removal of parts of the stream from the ID system's view. 

-> One example of an evasion attack is when an attacker opens a TCP connection with a data packet.

-> Before any TCP connection can be used, it must be “opened” with a handshake between the two endpoints of the connection.

-> An essential fact about TCP is that the handshake packets can themselves bear data. The IDS that does not accept the data in these packets is vulnerable to an evasion attack.
