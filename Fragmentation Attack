-> IP packets must follow the standard Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size while traveling across the network. 

-> If the packet size is exceeded, it will be split into multiple fragments (“fragmentation”). 

-> The IP header contains of a fragment ID, fragment offset, fragment length, fragments flags, and others besides the original data. 

-> In a network, the flow of packets is irregular; hence, systems need to keep fragments around, wait for future fragments, and then reassemble them in order. 

-> Fragmentation can be used as an attack vector when fragmentation timeouts vary between the IDS and the host.

-> If, for example, the fragment reassembly timeout is 10 s at the IDS and 20 s at the target system, attackers will send the second fragment 15 s after sending the first fragment. 
In this scenario, the IDS will drop the fragment on receiving the second fragment after its reassembly timeout, but the target host will reassemble the fragments.
